# Practice Project: Data Exploration

## Overview
This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a classic diamond dataset containing prices and various attributes of nearly 54,000 diamonds. The goal is to analyze the dataset to uncover insights and visualize relationships between different features.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the diamonds dataset from the `seaborn` library. It includes the following attributes:

- **price**: Price in US dollars (ranging from $326 to $18,823)
- **carat**: Weight of the diamond (0.2 to 5.01)
- **cut**: Quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)
- **color**: Diamond color, from J (worst) to D (best)
- **clarity**: Measurement of how clear the diamond is (I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best))
- **x**: Length in mm (0 to 10.74)
- **y**: Width in mm (0 to 58.9)
- **z**: Depth in mm (0 to 31.8)
- **depth**: Total depth percentage
- **table**: Width of the top of the diamond relative to the widest point

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```
3. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To run the Jupyter Notebook for the EDA, execute:
```bash
jupyter notebook "Practice Project - Data Exploration.ipynb"
```

## Analysis
The notebook includes various analyses, including:
- Data loading and initial exploration
- Visualizations of relationships between carat, depth, table, and price
- Missing value analysis
- Outlier analysis
- Class imbalance analysis
